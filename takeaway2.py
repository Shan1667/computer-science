#When the user enters:
#1 -> 0
#2 -> 1
#3 -> 2

#1. Read throught the program, then run it to make sure you understand what it is doing.
#2. Ask the user for their name and save it in an appropriately named variable.
#3. Include the user's given name in the print statement where they are thanked for their order.
#4. Write a loop that calculates the total value of the order and prints this number to the screen with an appropriate description.
#5. Alter the program so the delivery_fee is added to the total price of the order unless the
    #total value of the food is greater than value of free_delivery_price. Print this new value to the screen with appropriate text.
#6. Create a function called get_bill_total that combines the code added in step 4 and 5. Have the program call this function.
